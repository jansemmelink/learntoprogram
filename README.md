# Learn to Program #

## Introduction ##

This project will teach you how to program with simple step-by-step guides and examples. Work trough all the topics carefully and at the end you will be a good programmer.

## Getting Started ##

In all the examples I use the Go programming language. It is also called `golang` sometimes. The same thing. It is a modern programming language developed by Google. I use it because it is a good language and quite easy to learn.

It is possible to program from your tablet or phone without a normal keyboard but it will be harder than using a computer.

For the first programs, you do not need to install any software. You can use the online [Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/).

Work through the following topics in the playground to get you going:
- [Your first program: Hello world!](topics/hello_world/README.md)
- [Integer and String Values](topics/int_and_string_values/README.md)
