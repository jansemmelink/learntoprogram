# Learn to Program #
## Install Go ##

You need to install two things (_if not already installed_):
- An editor like Visual Stodio Code, where you will write your programs.
- The Go programming language, which makes the computer understand your program.

Both are free and you can install them on any Windows, Apple or Linux computer.

The installation instructions are here:
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install [Go](https://go.dev/)

## Terminal ##

Programming works very well from a terminal. Many people seldom use a terminal, and you may not even know what a terminal is!

You do not have to use a terminal, but if you really want to program, it is a good thing to use sooner rather than later. You can also use your editor, which will have a built-in terminal.

For this part, it will be good to get someone to help you just to get started.

A terminal is also a program on your computer, similar to a word processor, where you can type:
- A word processor however is like a book full of paper and you create documents for **people** to read and you will use headings and pictures to make the document pretty.
- A terminal on the other hand is where you type things for your computer to read. These are instructions and your computer will listen to you, as long as you type the instructions correctly.

You can open a terminal in Windows or Apple Mac or Linux from your normal launch pad. Just search for 'terminal' if you do not see it on your desktop.

The terminal will simply be an empty screen waiting for you to type something.

Type:

```go version```

Then press [enter].

If your Go installation is working fine, it will tell you what version of Go was installed. When I wrote this, my version was:
```go version go1.18.1 darwin/amd64```

There is a newer version go1.19 already available and when you read this, it might even be newer than that.

The last part of the version in my cases says `darwin/amd64`. This simply means I am running Go on an Apple Macbook, and my computer has an amd64 type processor. This is not important for you. Just take note. Your's will likely be different.

## Folders or Directories ##

It is good to keep all the programs you write somewhat organised.

In Windows, you will call it a `folder`. In Apple Mac and Linux we call it a `directory`. It is the same things.

Create a directory on your computer where you will put all your programs. You can for example create a directory in `Documents` and call the new directory `MyPrograms`.

Open that directory and then for every example or exercise we create, you create a new directory using a descriptive name.

I do not like spaces or uppercase letters in my directory and file names, so I would create a new directory called `hello_world` then do that exercise, or `int_and_string_values` then do that exercise etc.
